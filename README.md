# Machine Learning Models Repository
This repository contains Python files implementing various Machine Learning models for both regression and classification tasks. Each model is designed to handle specific types of predictive analytics tasks, leveraging different algorithms tailored to the nature of the problem.

# Implemented Models
Linear Regression: Used for regression tasks. Simple and effective for linear relationships in data.

Random Forest: Effective for both regression and classification tasks. Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.

Decision Tree: Primarily used for classification tasks. Simple tree-like structure for decision making.

Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification tasks. Estimates probabilities using a logistic function.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Used for both regression and classification tasks. Non-parametric method based on similarity to neighboring data points.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective for both regression and classification tasks. Finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data points.

# Data Availability

All datasets used in the models are uploaded to this repository. However, some large datasets are not included due to size limitations on GitHub. For those datasets, you will need to download them separately. Most of the datasets are available on Kaggle, and you can find them by searching for the dataset names or related keywords on the Kaggle website. Instructions for obtaining and using these datasets are provided in the respective Python files.

# Implementation Details
## Python Libraries:
The implementations use the pandas library for data handling, which provides easy access and manipulation of the datasets.

## Usage: 
Each Python file corresponds to a specific model and task combination (e.g., regression with Linear Regression and Random Forest, classification with KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree).

# Notes
 Ensure that you correctly reference the paths to the data files. If your setup differs from the provided examples, you may need to adjust the paths accordingly.
 
 These implementations serve as foundational examples. Feel free to adapt and extend them for your specific machine learning projects.
